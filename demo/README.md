## Thin Vue 3 wrapper for [plotly.js](https://plot.ly/javascript/)

This is README for the demo page, which is published in GitHub Pages [in this link](https://clalarco.github.io/vue3-plotly/demo).


## Code improvements

The demo page has the following improvements respective to the [original demo](https://github.com/VanOord/vue3-plotly/tree/main/demo):

- It uses `Vite` to build.
- It uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` syntax, and also `onMounted`, `watchEffect` and `Ref`.
- It uses spread syntax to create the data instead of `push()`
